# Git Pull and Merge Conflicts

In this activity, we will walk through a situation to learn about merge conflicts and how to handle them using Git and GitHub. Merge conflicts arise when one version of your project looks one way and another version looks slightly different, causing Git to prompt you to address and confirm which version is correct so that you can move on.

To learn how to identify and fix merge conflicts, we'll first create a repository on GitHub and clone it to our machines, then we'll force the local and remote (GitHub) repositories to diverge by making changes to the same file in each location. When we try to get them back in sync, we'll be confronted with a merge conflict.

This specific type of conflict is not as common as others you will face throughout your career as a developer. These types of conflicts typically arise when we collaborate with others and the projects become more complex, so this is a good opportunity to learn how conflicts may come about and how we can address them without the increased pressure of a larger application.
